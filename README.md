## What the project does
The AdventureXP Reservation Management System is a software product developed from scratch using the XP methodology. It is designed to manage reservations for the various activities offered by the AdventureXP center, such as Gocart, Minigolf, paintball, and sumo wrestling. The system is also capable of managing equipment maintenance, and handles both private and company reservations. It supports different age limits for the individual activities and provides a simple, efficient way to manage reservations.

## Why the project is useful
Before the AdventureXP Reservation Management System was developed, all reservations were made by telephone. This process was time-consuming and inefficient, often resulting in overbookings or double bookings. The new system provides a more streamlined way to manage reservations, saving time and reducing errors. It also helps ensure that the center is operating in compliance with the different age limits for the various activities.
